- Affinity Analysis 

    Look at which 2 products are often bought together to suggest additional 
      products to customers

    "If a person buys product X, then they are likely to purchase product Y."

    Affinity analysis can prove correlation, but not causation.



- Support and Confidence

    Support    = number of times a rule occurs in a dataset

    Premise    = the requirements for a rule to be considered active
    Conclusion = the output of the rule

    Confidence = how accurate rules are when they are used

    (Example)
    Rule       = 
    Premise    = "If a person buys an apple, they also buy a banana."
    Conclusion = "The person will buy a banana."
